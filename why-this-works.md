# Why This Works

**1. Artists Win Big**:

```
Traditional: $50K label advance → Repay $400K over career
Kord: $50K patient capital → Keep 100% future royalties
+ Passive LP growth from their own streams
```

**2. Fans Get Real Ownership** (not NFTs):

```
NFTs: "Own this JPEG" → Worth $0 in 6 months
Kord: "Own this album's revenue stream" → 
AUDIO royalties → LP value → Tradeable asset
```

### **3. Tokenomics Impossible to Ruin**:

```
Fixed 1M supply → No inflation
LP auto-fed → Guaranteed buy pressure
Anchor multisig → Trusted revenue flow
```

**4. Audius Perfect Integration**:

```
500K+ artists/fans already onboarded
AUDIO token rewards = perfect royalty proxy
Streaming data = verifiable success metric
```

#### The Flywheel Effect <a href="#flywheel" id="flywheel"></a>

```
1. Successful projects → Token price ↑
2. Happy artists → More projects  
3. Fans see ROI → Bigger investments
4. Platform fees → Better UX/marketing
5. → Repeat
```

#### Economic Reality Check <a href="#economics" id="economics"></a>

**Real numbers from indie music**:

```
Average indie album: 1M streams Year 1 → 5K AUDIO ($15K)
Tour 10 cities: $25K net profit
Merch: $10K
Total Year 1 revenue: $50K → 100% LP growth
```

**Artist still nets $35K cash upfront** + future royalties + token vesting.

**Kord** = **"Artists need funds. Fans want ownership. We tokenized the bridge."**

**One protocol. Two winners. Infinite albums.** 🎵⚡
