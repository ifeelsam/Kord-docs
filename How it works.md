# How it works

**Phase 1: Tokenized Proposal (Artist-Only, 5 Minutes)**

```
1. Artist connects Phantom wallet on Kord/Audius
2. Fills proposal: "Echoes Album - $50K needed - 60 days"
3. Uploads budget breakdown (validated automatically)
4. Selects minimum perks: 1% AUDIO royalties, early drop, merch discount
5. Clicks "Launch" → KordFactory deploys:
   → SPL Token: 1M total supply (fixed)
   → MilestoneVault: Escrows 90% funds
   → Raydium LP: 10% seed liquidity
```

### 🎵 **Phase 2: Fan Investment (Permissionless Crowdfunding)** <a href="#components" id="components"></a>

```
Fans discover on Audius/Kord Explore:
→ "Echoes Album - 73% funded - $36K raised"
→ "Invest $100" → Swap SOL/USDC → Receive 1,000 ECHO tokens instantly
→ Real-time progress bar + token price chart
```

**Fixed tokenomics eliminates scams**:

```
50% Public Sale → Immediate fan access
20% Initial LP → Trading starts day 1
20% Anchor Royalties → AUDIO stream capture
10% Artist Vesting → 12mo linear (skin in game)
```

**Phase 3: Milestone Accountability (Earned Funding)**

```
Artist uploads IPFS proof → Community verifies:
✅ Milestone 1: "5 demos complete" → 20% ($10K) released
✅ Milestone 2: "Mixing finished" → 30% ($15K) released
✅ Final: "Album live on Audius" → 50% ($25K) released
```

**No rugs possible**: Funds locked until delivery.

**Phase 4: Automatic Value Creation (The Magic)**

```
Month 1 post-release: Album gets 500K Audius streams
→ Generates 2,500 AUDIO tokens ($7.5K @ $3/AUDIO)
→ Anchor Org collects → Auto-deposits Raydium LP
→ ECHO token price: $0.10 → $0.23 (130% appreciation)
→ Fans holding 1K tokens: $100 → $230 profit
```

**Month 12**: Album hits 10M streams → Consistent AUDIO flow → Stable LP growth → Token becomes blue-chip music asset.
